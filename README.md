# 🗺️ AutoMapAU: Automated Suburb-to-Region Mapping Platform for Australia

AutoMapAU is a fully open-source, Python-based geospatial automation project designed to map all ~17,000+ Australian suburbs to accurate, SEO-friendly regions using authoritative data sources like ABS shapefiles and postcode boundaries. The platform integrates fuzzy logic, proximity-based geolocation, and spatial validation to ensure every suburb receives a correct and meaningful region assignment.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

To enable developers, analysts, and businesses to automate the transformation of raw suburb-level datasets into rich, regionally grouped insights without relying on manual data entry, third-party services, or guesswork.

AutoMapAU aims to be:

- 📍 **Accurate**: Uses official geospatial boundaries (SA4) from the ABS.
- ⚙️ **Automated**: Fully Python-driven pipeline with layered matching and QA.
- 🌐 **Interactive**: Streamlit dashboard to search, filter, map, and explore.
- 🔄 **Reusable**: Modular design for integration into other projects or business processes.

---

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Digital marketing**: Group suburb-level leads or customers into larger SEO-friendly regions (e.g. "Western Sydney", "Gold Coast").
- **Sales territory planning**: Align sales/service coverage based on regional logic.
- **Government/NGO outreach**: Aggregate suburb data into standard ABS reporting zones.
- **Logistics & delivery**: Assign operational zones or cluster deliveries by mapped region.
- **Geospatial analytics**: Enrich customer or user data with regional groupings.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pandas, NumPy, RapidFuzz** – for data processing and fuzzy matching
- **SciPy (KDTree)** – for proximity-based region assignment
- **GeoPandas + Shapefiles** – for spatial joins using ABS SA4 + SAL
- **Streamlit + Folium** – for dashboarding and map visualisation
